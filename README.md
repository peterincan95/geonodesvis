# Mapping Geospatial Data with Geometry Nodes in Blender
This repo contains the resources needed to follow along with the tutorial posted to my website [here](https://peteratwoodprojects.wordpress.com).
## Tutorial.blend
This is the .blend file containing the end result of the tutorial.
## Animation.mp4
The output animation that you will get by rendering Tutorial.blend
## Earthquakedata.csv
The initial dataset used in the tutorial. This contains the location, depth and magnitude of every earthquake since 2018.
## EarthquakeDataClean.csv
The dataset formatted for import into Blender, modified from the original dataset in the following ways:
* All unneeded fields are removed
* The date field has been converted to a frame value
## Recipes.blend
This blend file a series of node groups and materials that offer some interesting ways to experiment with geometry nodes. I'll be updating this with more resources over time.
